	abstract = {The dynamics of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA during translation and replication within infected cells were added to a previous age-structured multiscale mathematical model of HCV infection and treatment. The model allows the study of the dynamics of HCV RNA inside infected cells as well as the release as virus from infected cells and the dynamics of subsequent new cell infections. The model was used to fit in vitro data and estimate parameters characterizing HCV replication. This is the first model to our knowledge to consider both positive and negative strands of HCV RNA with an age-structured multiscale modeling approach. Using this model we also studied the effects of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in blocking HCV RNA intracellular replication and the release of new virions and fit the model to in vivo data obtained from HCV-infected subjects under therapy.},

	abstract = {Yellow fever (YF) is a life-threatening mosquito-borne flaviviral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) characterized by severe hepatitis, renal failure, hemorrhage, and rapid terminal events with shock and multi-organ failure. A live, attenuated vaccine (YF 17D), in wide use for over 60 years, causes a disease identical to wild-type virus at an incidence of 2.5 × 10−6. Our current understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of YF (described in this brief review) is derived from studies of animal models (macaques, hamsters) that reproduce the features of human YF and from descriptive studies of human cases of naturally acquired and vaccine-associated VHF. The least understood, but potentially most important terminal events appear to be due to ‘cytokine storm’ and represent a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Areas for future study include dissection of cytokine-mediated events in animal models, the pathogenic role of the profound neutrophilia that occurs pre-terminally, the (pathological) role of adaptive immune clearance in pathogenesis, and treatments directed at cytokine storm. Antibody, interferon-α, polyICLC and other immune modulators are highly effective when administered before or within a narrow time window after infection, but are ineffective when given after the infection is established. A few antivirals have been evaluated (ribavirin, tiazofurin, carboxamide, pyrazoline compounds). Ribavirin has been used successfully to treat hamsters when the drug is given at high doses up to 2 days after virus infection (shortly before liver infection), but has not shown promise in nonhuman primate models. Future work should focus on evaluating higher doses of ribavirin alone or in combinations with potentially synergistic drugs, including interferons. Also specific inhibitors against other flaviviruses such as dengue virus should be investigated for potential pan–flavivirus activity since recent studies have shown that specific targets such as the flavivirus proteases and helicases are very similar in structure.},

	abstract = {The development of mathematical models of the immune response allows a better understanding
of the multifaceted mechanisms of this defense system. The main purpose of this
work is to represent different scales and aspects of the host-pathogen interaction during
infection and treatment by the coupling of distinct mathematical models. Two examples
are defined. On the first example the local tissue inflammation processes are described by
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) whereas a system of Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODEs) is used as a model for the systemic response. The simulation of distinct
scenarios allows the analysis of the dynamics of different immune cells in the presence of
a bacteria. It was shown with the qualitative analysis of the results of the coupled model
that the systemic response is essential to eliminate the bacteria. In the second example a
set of ordinary differential equations representing infection of the hepatitis C virus (HCV)
is coupled to a set of partial differential equations that was developed to represent intracellular
dynamics. That example allowed the study of HCV replication under therapy using
direct acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) and was validated comparing to experimental data.
The results support that with the coupling of computational models, other mathematical
analysis and simulations could be performed, in a reasonable time frame, aiding to the
study of the complex immune system and the development of treatment to infections.},

	volume = {13},
	issn = {1359-6535},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The standard model of hepatitis C virus (HCV) dynamics under high-dose daily interferon (IFN) therapy assumed that the drug effectiveness remains constant. However, for treatment with pegylated (PEG)-IFN-alpha2b dosed weekly, drug levels fall substantially and viral load rebounds have been observed toward the end of the weekly dosing interval, implying non-constant drug efficacy.
METHODS: In this paper, we developed the decreasing effectiveness (DE) model, a new mathematical model that allows the drug effectiveness to change with time.
RESULTS: The DE model can describe viral load rebounds as well as other viral kinetic patterns observed in clinical practice, such as biphasic viral declines. We applied the DE model to the HCV RNA kinetic data under PEG-IFN-alpha2b therapy. The average drug effectiveness during the first week of therapy estimated in the DE model agreed with the one estimated from HCV RNA kinetic data plus pharmacokinetic data.
CONCLUSIONS: We illustrated the usefulness of the DE model by analysing HCV RNA data from patients who received PEG-IFN-alpha2b once weekly plus daily ribavirin.},
